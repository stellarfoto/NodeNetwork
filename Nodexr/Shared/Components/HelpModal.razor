    Drag-and-drop nodes from the left panel to insert them into the main window.
    The final result/output of your nodes is displayed at the top left.
    Information about each node can be found by clicking the <i style="font-size:smaller; margin:0.2em" class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> button next to its title.

<h4>Constructing an expression:</h4>
<p>
    The main concept is that the nesting behaviour of regex is expressed by connecting
    one node to the input of another, but items in sequence are connected using the <i>Previous</i>
    input at the top left of each node.
    The output expression will be empty unless one or more nodes are connected to the Output node.
